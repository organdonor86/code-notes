openvpn --config *VPN CONFIG FILE*   (usr and pass from vpnbook site)

 - won't pass DNS leak test like this alone though

Search DNS leak test to check - click test. Will show details of your isp nameserver. 

/etc/resolv.conf - List name servers, use open dns nameservers. Own ISP nameserver then hidden.

cmd - ifconfig (view hardware info with MAC address)

mac address looks like - ether 08:00:27:63:c4:7a  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)


cmd - macchanger --help

cmd - macchanger -s eth0 (also gets mac address, -s = show) 

cmd - macchanger -r eth0 (-r, random mac address)


nslookup 192.1.1.4322 - look up ip address, get domain.
nslookup 



##### nmap ##### - Scan a network

nmap -v (verbose output)

--help = -iL (pass filename in with list of targets)


Perform Scan - ip range, lookup that -oG, scan certain port number, verbose output, redirect output to a file

nmap -oG - 10.0.0.0-100 -p 22 -vv > ~/Desktop/scan

cat scan | grep Up - grep in terminal to get info from scan file.

cat scan | grep Up | awk -F " " '{print $2}' > ~/Desktop/scan2     (field delimiter?)

 - pipe to awk to get just ip's
